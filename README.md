# AgenticRenderer

A **Vulkan renderer** project where rendering features are implemented purely through AI agents. This is a personal sandbox to experiment with >99% AI-agentic coding and minimal manual involvement. Expect rapid iterations, exploratory features, and automation-first workflows.

## Overview

This project aims to build a modern Vulkan rendering engine with features implemented entirely by AI agents, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted graphics programming. 

**Fair warning:** I fully expect the resulting code and file/folder structure to be completely shit. This is an experiment in seeing what happens when AI agents have free reign over a graphics project. The README.md and git commit messages might also be totally AI-generated.

## Libraries

The project leverages the following libraries:

- **[SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)** - Cross-platform window and input handling
- **[NVRHI](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/nvrhi)** - NVIDIA Rendering Hardware Interface for graphics API abstraction
- **[glTF](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf)** - 3D asset loading and scene representation
- **[Taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow)** - Modern C++ parallel task programming

## Rendering Features

The following rendering features will be implemented by AI agents:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Deferred Lighting** | Deferred shading pipeline with G-buffer for efficient multi-light rendering |
| **GPU-Driven Rendering** | Indirect draw calls, GPU culling, and command buffer generation |
| **Ray Tracing** | Hardware-accelerated ray tracing for reflections, shadows, and ambient occlusion |
| **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)** | Material system with metallic-roughness workflow |
| **Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)** | High-quality temporal anti-aliasing |
| **Mesh Shaders** | Modern geometry pipeline using mesh shaders |
